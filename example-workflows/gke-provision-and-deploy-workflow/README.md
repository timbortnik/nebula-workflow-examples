# Deploy a Gatsby site to Google Cloud Project with Terraform       

This sample workflow deploys a simple Gatsby site to Google Cloud Project (GCP).
The workflow provisions a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster on
GCP using Terraform, and deploys the app to the cluster.

The workflow should appear on the **Workflows** page in your Nebula web interface. If you don't see
it there, add the workflow from our [examples repo](https://github.com/puppetlabs/nebula-workflow-examples/tree/master/example-workflows/gke-provision-and-deploy-workflow) on GitHub. 

## Prerequisites

Before you run the workflow, make sure you have access to the following:
- A Slack authentication token. For more information, see [Getting a Slack token](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/215770388-Create-and-regenerate-API-tokens).
- An SSH key associated with your GitHub account. Encode the key using the base64
  encoding scheme.  
- A GCP project
- A GCP service account with the following permissions:
  - Cloud KMS Admin
  - Compute Admin
  - Kubernetes Engine Admin
  - Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin
  - Editor
  - Role Administrator
  - Security Admin
  - Service Networking Admin
  - Source Repository Administrator
  - Storage Admin
  - Storage Object Admin
  > For more information on creating a service account, see [Creating and
  > managing service
  > accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts).
- Your GCP service account key. Encode the key using the base64
  encoding scheme. For more information on creating a service account key, see [Creating and managing service account
  keys](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#iam-service-account-keys-create-gcloud).
- Make sure you've enabled Google Cloud's [Identity and Access Management (IAM) API](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/)
- Make sure you've enabled Google Cloud's [Kubernetes Engine API](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/reference/rest/)
